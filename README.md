## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to learn how to push my code on github using the commandline. I can finally say am a git & github pro :)

```css
form input:nth-child(2) {
    width: 33%;
    padding: 5px;
    font-size: 15px;
    color: var(--very-pale-blue);
    background-color: var(--pink);
    border-radius: 7px;
    margin-top: 10px;
    font-weight: 600;
    position: absolute;
    right: 35px;
}

```



### Continued development

I struggled abit with CSS Grid so it is an area I should add re-visit and refresh my muscle memory.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - This helped me to refresh my muscle memory on CSS Grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
